Chapter 1: The Lighthouse

When the monks started dying of a mysterious illness, Dr. Ulko arrived on the scene. Unfortunately for him, the monks got the story backwards and believed that the presence of the outsider caused the disease, and not that the disease caused the presence of the outsider. Whether or not they were right is anybody's guess.

They decide to exile him to the Netherworld...

Ulko wakes up on a beach, the ebb and flow licking his feet. His head is hurting. He tries to stand up, but is taken by vertigo and falls back down. There's a little boy watching.
Ulko sees the little boy right before passing out.

Ulko wakes up again, this time in a bedroom in a small house. There's a woman tending to him.
-Take it easy, she says. How did you end up on the beach?
There's a silence. Ulko puts his hand on his forehead.
-Don't you remember? she asks.
-Do you have any aspirin?
-I don't know what that is.
-Nevermind. Where am I?
-In my house. My name is Phoebey. What's your name?
-I didn't ask for your name.
She pauses.
-I'll get you more water, and something to eat.
She leaves.

Ulko sees the little boy standing there.
-Hey kid, wanna see something cool?
Ulko takes out vials of different colors from his bag. Mixing them together, the vial contents go from opaque to transparent to opaque again in a cyclic fashion. The cycle looks as if it would continue until the end of time. The little boy claps his hands.
-Are you a wizard?
Feeling weak, Ulko falls back down onto the bed as the woman comes back.
-Please David, our guest needs to rest.
-Yes, mama.
The little boy leaves. The woman puts a jug of water and a piece of bread on the night table. She then starts to unbutton Ulko's shirt. He grabs her hand.
-I want to see if you're hurt, she says.
-I'm fine.
-Then I suppose...
-Ulko.
-What?
-My name is Ulko.
-Oh. Ok.
They both look at each other in silence.
-I'll let you rest now. Yell if you need anything.
-Not going to do that. But thanks.

The woman sits alone at the kitchen table, staring at the photograph of a man.
-Why does he look so much like you? she wonders.

The following day, Ulko is up outside the house, leaning on a piece of wood. Phoebey comes out behind him.
-You seem to have regained some of your strength.
-Do you know how I can get out of here?
-Get out of here? I suppose you must be in a rush. Where are you from?
-The real world.
-I'm sorry?
-Sorry, I'm still trying to figure out whether this place is a hallucination or a dream. So far, I'm leaning more towards the former.
-Then, maybe you should stay here for a while.
-Would love to, but I believe I left the stove on in another hallucination. Excuse me.
Ulko starts to walk down the path to the North, leaning on his improvised walking stick.
-Wait!
Phoebey runs into the house and comes back with a small bag.
-For the road.
Ulko hesitates before taking the bag.
-You should try speaking with the wizard of the lighthouse, she adds. He'll give you some good advice. He can be found at the end of the northern path.
Ulko walks away as Phoebey and David watch him leave.
-Who is he, mama?
-I don't know, honey. I don't know.

When Ulko feels he's walked far enough, he stops and releases his pet bird Rey from his bag.
-'twas about time! complains the bird.
-I didn't want them to think that I speak to birds.
-But you do.
-Yes. But I know you're not real, so it doesn't count.
-If I'm not real, what's the point in keeping me hidden?
-I already regret letting you out.

They walk all day, the ocean to their left and farms and fields to their right. The lighthouse becomes visible on a cliff as the sun goes down beneath the waves. Exhausted from the long walk, Ulko stops, leaning on his stick.

-Why are we stopping? complains Rey. The lighthouse is right there.
-I want to watch the sunset.
-No you don't. What is it? You scared?
Pause.
-We're almost there, says Ulko. Come on, let's go.

Ulko climbs the hill that leads to the lighthouse. It's getting dark but the beacon isn't lit yet.
He knocks on the door. A voice answers.
-Whatever it is you're selling, I'm not interested! *cough cough cough*
-How long have you had this cough?
-None of your business!
-I too am a wizard of sorts. I'll cure you if you open the door!
-Ha! I'd like to see that! *cough cough cough cough*
-Stop yelling, you're making it worse!

The door opens. An old man appears.
-What do you want?
-Don't move.
Ulko takes out a vial from his bag and fills up a dropper.
-You were saying? asks Ulko.
As the wizard opens his mouth to speak, Ulko quickly squeezes the content of the dropper down his throat.
-*cough cough* What was that?? You tricked me!
-Relax. In a minute, you won't have a care in the world.

The wizard slams the door shut.
-Well played, mocks the bird.
-Just you wait.

Fifteen minutes later, the door opens up on its own. Ulko enters. The wizard is nowhere to be seen.
-Upstairs, commands Ulko.
-You're the boss.

As they reach the top of the stairs, they're blinded by a bright light. The wizard is dancing around a white fire.
-Thank you stranger! I had no idea how I was going to get up those stairs! I feel like a 120 year old again!
-Calm down. You'll hurt yourself.
-What is this magic? You must be a very powerful wizard!
-Sort of. Listen, I need your help to go back to where I come from.
-I'm afraid I would make a pretty terrible guide.
-I'm not from this world.
-Really?

The wizard approaches Ulko with curiosity. He grabs his hands, palms facing up.
-Interesting. It seems your existence has no beginning and no end. Very interesting indeed.
-So, can you send me back?
-I cannot do it for you. You'll have to do it yourself.
-Can you teach me then?
-Not right now. Right now we sleep. *yawn* Don't you feel sleepy?

The wizard points to a rag on the floor as he slips under the covers of his own improvised bed.
Ulko sits down and takes out his vial again.
-What are you doing? asks Rey.
-I'll need some powerful magic too if we're going to sleep on the floor.
-I thought you'd quit.

Ulko drinks from the vial before lying down.
He's exhausted and hungry, but soon both of those sensations go away as he drifts into a peaceful slumber.

The morning sun shines through Ulko's eyelids as a throbbing headache wakes him up. He sits down slowly, a hand on his forehead.
-You look like shit, says Rey.
-I slept on the goddamn floor.
He takes a sip from his vial.
-Come on. You know your headache is caused by hunger and dehydration.
-See any water or food around?
He takes another sip.
-*cough cough cough* goes the wizard.
-Good morning, says Ulko.
-I can't even get up. Everything hurts.
-It's normal. You were dancing on your old bones last night. Here.

Ulko stands up and gives him a drink from the vial.
A few minutes later, the wizard manages to sit up.
-You'll have to teach me the recipe of this potion, wizard!
-That wouldn't be legal.
-Legal?
-And stop calling me wizard. I'm Ulko.
-And I'm Ferlintokezeir. Pleasure.

The wizard stands up to shake his hand but Ulko puts one hand on the wall and the other on his forehead, leaving none to shake.
-Sit down lad, orders the wizard. I'll get us some breakfast.

Ulko leans forward onto the window sill as the wizard makes his way down the stairs. He looks at the ocean, lost in thought and in the vastness of that space. For a moment there, it almost feels real. The wizard comes back with food and water. Without even asking, Ulko grabs the jug of water and gulps it all down in one go. He sighs in relief.
-Feeling better?
-Now, can you teach me how to go back home?
-Later. First, we eat.

The wizard sits down on the floor, legs crossed. Ulko does the same.
The wizard happily starts eating the food while Ulko looks at him.
-You're not eating, lad?
-I'm worried.
-About what?
-What if I'm stuck here.
-Nonsense! If you're in the wrong plane, it should be easier to send you back than to keep you here. Now eat up! You're white as a vampire.
-Do vampires exist here?
-What a strange question.
-Does it mean yes or no?
The wizard doesn't reply.

Moments later, Ulko and the wizard are out on the beach, facing each other at a distance like in a western movie.
-First, says the wizard, I need to see what kind of magic you possess.
-How about none.
-I don't believe that, wizard.
-Stop calling me wizard!

Without warning, the wizard sends a gust of wind down Ulko's way. Ulko jumps aside to dodge it.
-Hey, watch it! That almost hit me! yells Ulko.
The wizard doesn't listen and sends a gust of sand at Ulko. Ulko covers his eyes with his sleeve. It gives him an idea.
-So? yells the wizard.
Ulko grabs two tubes from his bag and a match. He merges the contents into one tube and drops the lit match in before throwing it on the sand. Ulko covers his eyes as the tube explodes in a blinding white light.
-A blinding curse! exclaims the wizard.
-Magnesium.
-Is that a spell?
-It's an element.
-Like wind and fire?
-Not exactly.

The wizard lifts a hand as he puts a knee to the ground.
-Can you remove the curse now? he asks, a little bit panicked.
-Relax. Your eyesight will return. I promise it will be just as bad as it was before.
Ulko helps him up.
-Just as I thought, says the wizard. I'd say, your type of magic is sorcery!
-If you say so.
-Now, can you help an old man go back home? I no longer know West from East.

Back in the lighthouse, the wizard rubs his eyes while he's making some tea. He brings the tea to the table where Ulko is sitting.
-That was truly remarkable! says the wizard.
-Will you teach me how to go home now?
-I'm afraid this wizard is no sorcerer.
-I thought those words were synonymous!
-Not at all. Wizards have specialties. Sorcerers specialize in curses. Witches specialize in psychicism. And elementalists specialize in-
-Aristotle's idea of physics?
-Who?? No! They specialize in the elements of nature of course!
-Elementary.
-What?
-Nothing. So, what do we do now?
-We seek knowledge. Tomorrow we're going to the Great Library.
Ulko slowly feels the physical and mental fatigue weighing on him.
-Why not, he sighs.






Chapter 2: The Library

The following day, Ulko is standing on the cliff, waiting for the wizard.
-I wonder what is taking him so long, complains the bird.
-Have some respect for the elderly. The plumbing doesn't work as well.
-Charming.

The wizard finally arrives. He's carrying lots of bags and books, much more than is suited for someone his age, but his step appears to be light. He passes by Ulko without stopping.
-Hey! yells Ulko through the wind. Are you sure it's wise to carry so much stuff? You'll break your back!
-Don't worry! The wind will carry me! Now come on, I can't stop it once it's started! Hurry up lad!
-Godammit, curses Ulko as he drops his walking stick to follow the wizard.

They walk briskly for a few hours along the coastal cliff. Ulko has a hard time keeping up. At last, the wizard stops.
-Lunch break!
Ulko comes in, panting.
-You're out of shape, lad. This should be easy for you.
-Look, he says struggling to breathe and talk, you're talking to someone... who considers that a 2 hour nap on an office chair is a good night sleep... and that triangular sandwiches from a vending machine is a healthy breakfast.
-You say some strange things, wizard. Now eat up, you'll need your strength for the toughest part of the trail.
-Stop calling me wizard!

The second part of the trail is indeed harder. It goes up a steep rocky hill that seems like it will never end. They finally reach the top.
-Ah! That cold fresh air is rejuvenating! says the wizard.
Ulko looks like he's about to die.
-If... if I have a heart attack... please don't ressucitate.
-Look! We can see the university from here.

Downhill lies a beautiful little town that would probably qualify as a city by this world's standard. The buildings are all made of the same dark grey stone while the rooftops all have different colors. There's a larger building in the middle that's towering over the rest.

-Come on lad, let's go find a pub! Tonight we party!
-Wherever I can rest my feet is fine by me.
The wizard carries on ahead without waiting for Ulko.
-Maybe I should discontinue his treatment, says Ulko. It works way too well on him.
-Don't be such a killjoy, replies Rey. Let him have some fun.
-Why not. He'll be sleeping on the table after one pint anyway.

The next thing we know, the wizard is fast asleep on the table in a little quiet pub. The sun isn't even down yet. Ulko grabs the wizard's pint and starts sipping it.
-I do hope he wakes up soon though. I highly doubt they accept dollars around here.
He then starts searching through the wizard's bag.
-Hey, what are you doing? asks Rey.
-What does it look like I'm doing? Ha ha! There it is.

Ulko retrieves what appears to be a wallet. It contains shiny metal coins of different sizes. Guessing the price of the beer by looking at the slates on the wall and a jar of tips, he puts a few coins on the table and stands up. He takes a few more coins from the wallet and puts the wallet back.

-You're not going to leave him like this! scolds Rey.
-Of course not, that would be rude.
Ulko takes a cushion from one of the chairs and puts it under the wizards head.
-There. That's better.

The sun is setting down on the city. Workers are lighting the street lights one by one.
The building next to the pub is a hotel. All they have to do is exit one door to enter the one that's merely a few feet to the left.

The following morning, they exit the hotel and enter the pub again. The wizard is still there, sleeping on the same table.
-You forgot your grandpa, complains the owner. I didn't touch it. It's right where you left it.
Ulko shakes the wizard.
-Hey. You alive?
The wizard mumbles something.
Ulko picks his head up and gives him a dose from one of his vials.
-Come on, rise and shine.
Suddenly, the wizard sits up, fully awake.
-*cough cough cough* What did you give me??
-Just a little pick-me-up. Let's get out of here before we get thrown out.

They exit the pub. The wizard doesn't look so well. He's shaking. Ulko takes a sip of his magic vial to get rid of his morning headache.
-May I get some too? *cough cough*
-I wouldn't recommend it. Try to survive until noon and I'll reevaluate.
-*cough cough* Not fair!

They slowly make their way to the central building. This time the wizard is the one lagging behind. They finally reach the doors of the university. The woman at the front desk watches them come in. The wizard is struggling to walk.
-Is your friend okay? she asks.
-He's old.
-Professor Ferlintokezeir? Is that you?
-Martha. It's been a while.
The wizard then collapses to the floor.
-Bummer, says Ulko.

The woman rushes to him. Ulko pushes her aside.
-Don't worry. I'm a doctor.
He kneels beside the wizard. He's still breathing, but his breathing is heratic. Ulko gently slaps him in the face.
-Hey, wake up.
-*cough cough*
-It's noon.
Ulko gives him a drink from the magic vial.
Soon afterwards, the wizard appears to relax. His breathing slows down. Ulko puts a hand on the wizard's chest. He sighs.
-All back to normal. I'm sorry buddy, Ulko whispers to himself. That was stupid.

A man in wizard robes comes rushing in. Ulko raises both hands in the air.
-He's fine. He's fine. False alarm.
-Ferlin? You traveled all the way up here?
-Hey Bob. Long time no see.
-Let's get you sorted out in my office. Can you stand? Let me help.
Using a levitation spell, the wizard named Bob helps Ferlin up.
Bob turns to Ulko who's been following them.
-Who are you?
-He's with me, says Ferlin.

They all end up in Bob's office. Ferlin is lying on the couch.
-It was foolish of you to make this trip Ferlin, scolds Bob. But I'm happy to see you.
-It's all thanks to my friend. He's a powerful sorcerer.
Bob turns to Ulko.
-He? A sorcerer?
Ulko shrugs.
-He's not from this plane, continues Ferlin. He's trying to go back home. Do you think you could show him the library perhaps? In case there's anything relevant to be found in there.
-I suppose I can do that for you. Meanwhile, you stay here. Get some rest. I'll tell Martha to come visit.

Ulko follows Bob in the corridors of the university.
-Say, Bob, what am I supposed to look for in the library?
-That's Bobalthar for you. And I don't know anymore than you do.
Suddenly, a student runs to them.
-Professor Bobalthar! There was another disappearance!
-Calm down, Jone, and tell me exactly what happened.
-The alchemy lab is nowhere to be found! And no one seems to remember where it was supposed to be! Professor, this curse is starting to freak me out!
-Alright Jone. Take a deep breath and meet me in my office in 10 minutes.
-Yes, professor.
-What was that about? asks Ulko.
-Nothing of your concern. Here's the library.

The corridor opens up to a gigantic room. Bookcases are piled all the way up to a round glass ceiling that looks like it could roof a ten story building. Ulko is impressed.
-That certainly isn't McGill.
-I don't know where that is. I'll leave you to it now. Good luck.

Bob leaves. Ulko takes a few steps on the reverberating floor, looking up at the books, wondering what to do next, when he sees a familiar face­. She's sitting at one of the tables, reading and taking notes. She looks up at him, as if she could sense his gaze.
-Ulko? she says.
-Do I know you?
She walks to him.
-You're the man we found on the beach! What a chance to see you here! Did you find the wizard?
-Yes. He's sleeping at Bob's.
-What?
-Nevermind. So you're...?
-A student here. Phoebey.
-How did you get here before me?
-I used teleportation.
-Of course. Silly me. Too bad I didn't think of that.
-Oh, but you can't teleport to a place you've never been to before.
-What about the wizard?
-Professor Ferlintokezeir doesn't do teleportation.
-Right. Anyway, it was nice to chat.

Ulko starts to walk away, to the left.
-Wait!
Phoebey grabs his hands and closes her eyes.
-Do not despair. There is a way home.
Ulko pauses for a moment before freeing himself. After he's made a few steps, he turns and throws something at Phoebey.
-Think fast.
Phoebey catches it.
-For the little monster, he says.
He then disappears behind the bookcases.
Phoebey opens her hands. It's a red sucker. She makes it roll between her index and thumb, observing it.
-Some sort of candy, she thinks.
She smiles.

Ulko walks between the bookcases.
-Alright, so what's my strategy here?
-Do you really think the books will be written in plain English? asks the bird.
-I don't see why not. Everyone has been speaking perfect English so far.
-You don't find it strange?
-It's not on my top 5, to be honest.

There's a book that sits open on a podium. Ulko takes a look at it.
It seems like an index.
He turns the pages.
-Think. What am I looking for?
The correct keywords lead to 3 suggestions:
Conjuring Portals to Distant Realms
The Sorcerer's Guide to Parallel Dimensions
Sorcery 101: Opening Doors in the Sky

Ulko finds all 3 books and brings them to a table in a far corner of the library.
He puts on a pair of glasses and starts to read.

Hours pass. It's now getting dark. The candle on the table is slowly being consumed.
Ferlin walks in.
-You're still here?
Ulko lifts his head briefly before going back to his reading.
-You should be resting, he says distractedly.
-I'm fine. That good old Bob has a few tricks up his sleeve too, in the white magic department.
-Glad to hear it.
Ferlin walks closer and stares at Ulko. Ulko lifts his head.
-What?
-Are you going to do this every day?
-Do what?
-Neglect your health.
Ulko frowns and goes back to his reading.
-This world isn't real. The faster I get out of here the better.
-If that's how you feel.
Ferlin takes a seat in front of Ulko and hands him a sandwich that was carved in the shape of an equilateral triangle.
Ulko takes the sandwich, puzzled.
-You said you like triangular sandwiches. I can't for the life of me understand why, given that bread is round.
Ulko starts laughing.
-I did something wrong?
Ulko keeps laughing wholeheartedly.
-My dear wizard, you just made my day.
-Oh. Good then. So, what have you found so far?
-I'm not sure. It's all theory. I fail to see how I'll be able to put it into practice.
-Why not?
-I can't do magic, Ferlin.
-Sure you can! Everyone can do magic!
-I'm not from this world.
-You're saying strange things again. Magic is not inside you, magic is all around you. You just have to grab it!
-Hm.
Ulko removes his glasses and rubs his hurting forehead.
-Close that book, orders Ferlin. It's too dark to read anyway. Here.
Ferlin hands Ulko a small key with the number 404 engraved on it.
-Your room.
Ulko takes the key.
-So I got the room not found, hey.
-No no, this one can be found! reassures the wizard. I double-checked. Just turn right when you get to the fourth floor!
Ferlin smiles naively as Ulko stares at him. He chuckles.
-Good thing you double-checked.
Standing up a bit too fast, Ulko feels dizzy and has to put one hand on the table. Ferlin has the reflex to catch him but Ulko shows the palm of his hand.
-I'm okay. Long day.
He grabs the sandwich and starts to leave.
-Thanks for the sandwich.






Chapter 3: The Curse

The next morning, Ulko walks into the library. Ferlin and Phoebey are sitting together, books open all over the table.
-Morning! chimes Phoebey.
Ulko walks to them.
-Morning, he says distractedly. What are you both doing?
-Research! We decided to help you.
-Thanks, but I don't need any-
Before he can finish his sentence, Phoebey shoves a cup of coffee into his hands.
-I think we mostly figured it out. Right, professor?
-Yes. Though I would very much like to consult Bob about the regression of ether triangulation. I'm not all that familiar with Kurby's theorem of magical attractors.

At that moment, Bob appears.
-Ah! Speaking of the devil!
-What is this mess you're making? complains Bob.
-Say Bob, how would you go about stabilizing magical attractors in mid air?
-I think I would use ether triangulation and regress the result onto a vertical grid. Why?
-Because today we're opening a portal to a distant plane! Join us in the yard in 15 minutes.
-I have to be in class at 9:30.
-Plenty of time! Come on, you know you're curious to see this!
Ferlin grabs a bunch of books and walks out, followed by Phoebey. Ulko shrugs at Bob before following them.

Out in the yard, Ferlin and Phoebey are standing a few feet from each other. Ulko stands in front of them. Bob is watching from a distance.
-Your time to shine lad! Do you understand what you have to do?
-No. But I'll do it anyways.
Bob shakes his head.
There's some sort of puzzle to solve at the issue of which, a portal opens.
Phoebey cheers.
-You did it!
-Good job, lad. Have a safe journey home.
Ulko slowly walks to the portal. He sticks his arm into it first and then steps in. He disappears and so does the portal.
Ferlin and Phoebey look at the ground.
-Oh well, says Phoebey. I guess I better go back to my studies.
-And I suppose I should return to my lighthouse.
Bob puts a hand on Ferlin's shoulder.
-You can stay here for as long as you want, Ferlin.
They all stay there in solemn silence when Ulko walks in.
Bob bursts out laughing.
-Alright. I have to go give a lecture now. It was entertaining!
Bob leaves.

-What happened? asks Phoebey.
-I ended up in the library.
-Hm. Maybe you didn't use enough ether. You should try again.
-Is it normal that I feel like shit though?
-Teleportation sickness is normal. Take a deep breath. It will pass.
They repeat the same ritual. Ulko enters the portal, only to be teleported to the library again.
-I keep being sent back to the library!
-Maybe it's because you still have something to learn, teases Ferlin.
-Very funny.

Suddenly, the student named Jone comes running.
-Professor Ferlintokezeir!
-What is it lad?
-Professor Leanupt is acting weird! I was in her class when she suddenly started to speak nonsense!
-What kind of nonsense? asks Ulko. The usual nonsense or unusual nonsense?
-Unusual!
-Lead the way, kid. Quickly!

Ulko rushes into the classroom to find Professor Leanupt sitting on the teacher's desk, staring into space. The students all seem confused as to what to do.
Ulko shines a flashlight into her eyes.
-Ma'am? I'm Dr. Ulko. Can you hear me?
Ulko takes a seringe, a rubber band and a vial from his bag. He proceeds to inject a dose of the liquid into her arm.
The woman then litterally disappears into thin air. Ulko takes a step back.
-That was unexpected, he says.
-What was? asks Jone.
-Is it normal for people to disappear into thin air around here?
-Disappear? You mean, run away?
-No, I mean-

Ulko pauses and looks at Jone.
-You really don't remember?
-Remember what?

Ulko turns around and realizes that all the students have disappeared as well.
Ferlin arrives on the scene, panting. Phoebey is with him. She looks around the classroom and puts her hands over her mouth.
-Not again, she whispers.
-This is getting weird, says Ulko.
-Let's talk in Bob's office, says Ferlin. Lad, go get Professor Bobalthar please.
-Yes professor, says Jone.

A few moments later, Ferlin, Bob, Phoebey and Ulko are sitting in Bob's office.
-People and things have started disappearing lately, explains Bob. And the memories of them too. It seems everyone is suffering from amnesia.
-But not you, Ulko points out.
-Correct. Some of us do remember. The amnesia seems to affect primarily students and new professors. My hypothesis is that it's a curse. It afflicts those who lack the magical ability to ward themselves against it.
-What about me then? I seem to remember.
-That's a mystery to me, outsider.
-I told you he's a powerful sorcerer! says Ferlin.
-Hm.
Bob thinks for a moment.
-If that is true then, maybe he's the source of the curse.
-Come on Bob, complains Ferlin. No sorcerer could do anything like this!
-How do we know? He's not from around here. Maybe his mere presence is poking holes in the fabric of existence.
Ferlin frowns.
-Look, Bob, says Ulko, I have no clue what's going on here. I just want to go home.
-That's Bobalthar for you.
Bob pauses.
-But I do agree. We need to send you back home. Ferlin, what have you discovered so far?
-Well, I think we got the correct techniques, but Ulko isn't familiar with them. He needs more training.
-What do you suggest?
-We should grant him tuition in this university. Sorcery major.
Bob looks at Ulko who raises a pair of innocent eyebrows back at him.
-So be it. I'll go talk to the dean.
Bob walks towards the door.
-In the meantime, outsider, make sure you behave properly.
Bob leaves.

-Yes, mom! mocks Ulko.
-Bob loves this university, explains Ferlin. He's just being careful. It's nothing against you.
-I don't really care, to be honest.
-The good news is, says Phoebey cheerfully, you have a good chance of being accepted if Professor Bobalthar roots for you! And then, you'll be home in no time!
-Aren't you a little ray of sunshine. Just because you're cheering doesn't mean things will go the way you want. That's how children think before they grow a brain, if they ever do.
The enthusiasm on Phoebey's face fades.
-I have to be in class, she says. Professor Ferlintokezeir, can we meet later today? I have a few questions I would like to ask a veteran elementalist.
-Sure thing, Phoebey.
Phoebey leaves.
-That was rude, scolds Ferlin.
-It was true.
Ferlin sighs.
-You're a tough nut to crack.
-I don't need to be cracked. I need to go home.
Ferlin sits next to Ulko.
-What if you can't? says Ferlin.
-You said it was easier to leave than it was to stay!
-It's all theory. No one from another plane has ever come here. You're the first.
-Gee, between the other cheerleader and your gloomy face I can get a pretty decent average!
-What I mean is, relax. You're stranded, you're not dead.
-Well, I'm not really sure which is better...
Ulko stands up and leaves. Ferlin shakes his head.

Ulko walks out in the corridor and takes out his vial. He takes a big gulp of it.
-Here we go again, complains the bird.
-I'm in pain. This is pain medicine.
-You should apologize to her.
-Just leave me alone will ya.
-You know, one day I might do just that.

At the same moment, a strange woman bumps into Ulko and snatches his bag.
-Hey that's mine! yells Ulko.
She opens up a portal to run away, but Ulko is fast enough to jump into it before it closes. They both end up in a completely different city. Ulko catches a glimpse of the woman and runs after her. The chase lasts a few minutes through the city streets when suddenly, the woman turns around and sends a bunch of gravel flying fast towards Ulko.
Ulko is hurt but he keeps chasing her. It seems the woman is about to get away when another woman jumps down from a rooftop right in front of her. It's Phoebey.

There's a fight between them. Turns out they're both witches. Phoebey manages to pin her adversary to the ground using her mind-controlled swords.
-Alright! Alright! I surrender!
-Who sent you? Speak, witch!
-It was Mother Karistal!
-Why?
-She wants the outsider's magic! I didn't do anything wrong! I was just following orders!
-Coward! Run back to your covenant, and stay there!
Phoebey lifts the swords and the witch runs away.
Ulko is still too winded to say a word.
-Let's go back, commands Phoebey, we're not welcome here!

She opens up a portal and they both get teleported back into Bob's office. Nobody's there.
Ulko falls down on the couch, still trying to catch his breath.
-Nice timing, he says.
-Those damn witches, curses Phoebey. Always up to no good!
-Aren't you a witch too?
-I'm a good witch, not like them.
-That's fortunate.
-You're lucky I saw you. I had a bad feeling on my way to class and ran back here. A minute later and you would have been stuck in Helmwood. Not a place you want to be stuck in.
-Anywhere in here is a place I don't want to be stuck in- Ow!

Phoebey suddenly goes back to being her gentle, caring self.
-You're hurt, she says.
-Just a few scratches. It's okay, I've got plasters in my bag.
Phoebey hands him his bag.
Ulko takes out a bottle of alcohol and a cotton pad. He starts to disinfect the wounds, hissing in pain.
-Let me, says Phoebey.
She grabs the pad and continues what he had started. This time Ulko seems to relax.
-How do you do that?
-Do what?
-It doesn't sting. It's supposed to sting.
-It still does. You just forgot.
She keeps dabbing the wounds in silence. Ulko looks at her.
-Why do you care about me? he asks.
-Why wouldn't I?
-You won't get anything for it. I'm not staying.
-I know that.
A shadow seems to pass on her face. She continues tending to Ulko in silence.

At that moment, Bob enters. He's holding a bunch of files.
-What are you both still doing in my office?
Phoebey jumps and drops the pad. Ulko grunts in pain.
-Professor Bobalthar, a witch tried to steal Ulko's bag! We chased her all the way to Helmwood!
-I told you not to go back there Miss Phoebey. That was very reckless of you.
-Yes, professor. I'm sorry.
-Why did they want the outsider's bag?
-She said she was sent by Mother Karistal. She said she wants Ulko's magic.
-Hm.
Bob drops the files on his desk and sits down, thinking.
-That old hag is nothing but trouble. I wonder what she's scheming again.
He distractly looks at the files, still deep in thought. After a moment he says:
-Outsider! Come here.
Bob takes out a piece of paper from one of the files.
-I need you to sign this.
Ulko stands up slowly and walks towards him. He grabs the quill that Bob hands him and signs the document.
-Congratulations. You're now officially a student. Classes start tomorrow. Here's your schedule.
-What great news! exclaims Phoebey. I'm so glad.
-Miss Phoebey, I count on you to show him around.
-Yes, professor!
-Now, dismissed. I have work to do.

They both end up in the corridor. They seem to be a little bit ill at ease with each other. It's now late afternoon. Golden rays stripe the light colored floor.
-You must be tired, says Phoebey.
-That's an understatement.
-I guess I'll let you rest then.
-That would be best, yes.
-Ok. So, see you tomorrow?
-Yes.
Phoebey starts to leave when Ulko calls her.
-Phoebey.
-Yes?
-Thank you for saving my bag.
-Don't worry about it.
-In any case, I owe you one. Good night.
-Good night, Ulko.
-David.
-What?
-My first name. Ulko is my last name.
-Oh. I see. Thank you for telling me.
Ulko leaves.
-David... whispers Phoebey.





Chapter 4: The Exile

The following morning, Ulko is woken up by a ruckus in the corridor. It doesn't help his morning headache.
-Good morning! bugles Rey.
-Any chance you can turn down the volume on this noisy crowd? says Ulko, still half-asleep.
-You're the wizard, do it yourself.
For only response, Ulko dismisses Rey with his hand and puts the pillow over his head.
Suddenly, someone bangs on the door. The door opens. It's Phoebey.
-Ulko! You have to come quickly!
-Please mom, 5 more minutes.
-Please! It's urgent that you see this!

Ulko follows Phoebey in the corridor all the way to the main hall where the students are gathering. Where there should have been tables and a tiled marble floor was a grassy soil and an entire forest with birds and small animals.
-Wow. Trees grow fast around here, says Ulko.
-It's not normal! exclaims Phoebey.
-And how exactly does it concern me? he replies, rubbing his forehead.

Ferlin comes rushing in.
-Interesting! Very interesting! This could be the work of an expert elementalist!
Bob walks next to him.
-Or a sorcerer. It's hard to tell.
Bob glances at the outsider. Ulko raises his eyebrows at him.
-Alright, says Bob, I'll go get the dean and we'll have an all-hands meeting. Not in the hall though. Outside. Ferlin, lead everyone to the yard.

Out in the yard, there's a small stage where the dean, Professor Albernon, is standing. Bob stands to his right. The students are all gathered on the lawn.
-May I get your attention please.
Albernon's voice resonates through a megaphone spell.
The chatter ceases in a matter of seconds.
-Thank you for your attention and your time. I believe you are all aware of the situation that compels us to hold this extraordinary meeting in the yard today. Some of you may be confused, some of you may be fearful, it is understandable. I think all of us, including myself, are a bit shaken right now. That being said, this is not our first rodeo, as you can tell by the number of wrinkles on our faces.
Albernon turns to Bob and gives him a cheeky smile.
-I believe -no, I know for a fact- that Professor Bobalthar loves this school even more than I do. You're in good hands. Together, we are dedicated to resolving this matter as quickly as possible.

Bob whispers something into Albernon's ear.
-Professor Bobalthar would like to say a few words.
Albernon takes a step back to let Bob enter the megaphone spell.
-The floor is yours Bob. Break a leg.
-Al, you know I've done this hundreds of times.
-So have I. And I still get nervous every single time.
Albernon gives a strong pat on Bob's back.

-I may have made a mistake, says Bob. And I want to apologize to all of you. There's a certain student who shouldn't be among us.
Bob looks straight at Ulko.
Phoebey steps in front of him.
-Professor, no!
-I'm sorry Miss Phoebey, but the school has to come first. No sorcerer known to man has ever performed the kinds of curses we've been seeing for the past few days. It's obvious to me, and to the faculty members, that this is a power well beyond our comprehension. It is not from this world. Therefore, the outsider will have to be expelled.
-But it's only my first day! complains Ulko.
-It was one day too many.
Bob steps away from the central stage. There's a rising chatter among the students. Professor Albernon takes the mic again.

-Consider the matter already half-solved, he says. Now, students, we will organize a cleaning party to take care of the main hall. If you want to volunteer, please stand next to the stage. Everyone else, you may resume your classes as usual.
With that said, a group of students moves towards the stage while the rest slowly disperses, still chatting nervously and eyeing Ulko in distrust.

Bob steps down from the stage and walks towards Ulko.
-I will escort you out of the school grounds, he says.
-Please Professor Bobalthar, pleads Phoebey, I know Ulko didn't do any of the things he's accused of! He only just showed up! How would that even be possible?
-Whether or not he's guilty is irrelevant. Peace must be brought back to the school, and I see no better solution.
-You can't really mean that, whispers Phoebey.
Bob puts his hand on Phoebey's shoulder but she frees herself.
-Then, I'm leaving too! she blurts out.
-Phoebey, be reasonable.
-I will lead Ulko to Helmwood! To Mother Karistal!
-Miss Phoebey, take a deep breath. You're not thinking clearly. Come. We'll talk this through in my office. All of us, he adds looking at Ulko. Okay?
Phoebey bows her head.

Ulko and Phoebey are sitting on the couch in Bob's office. Ferlin took the armchair. Bob is sitting at his desk.
-Bob, I understand your decision, says Ferlin. But we still need to figure out how to send Ulko home. We can't just let him wander around.
-That's why I say we go to Helmwood! adds Phoebey.
-Why Helmwood? asks Bob. Walk me through your reasoning.
-Mother Karistal is a master at teleportation. She's the only witch I know who can teleport to places she's never been to. If anyone can open a portal to Ulko's plane, it has to be her!
-Well, I bet the old hag would be more than happy to see the outsider walk straight into her covenant. The question is, what she would do afterwards. It might not be the outcome you're hoping for.
Phoebey thinks for a moment.
-Let's offer her a deal! she says. Ulko's magic in exchange for sending him home.
-Hm, says Bob.
Bob rests his chin in his hand for a moment, deep in thought.
-Hey guys, says Ulko. While you're all talking about me as if I'm not there, do you mind if I pay a visit to the lavatories?
-Be quiet, outsider. I'm thinking.
Ulko blinks twice at him. After a moment, Bob lifts his head up.
-Alright, he says. I'll send Mother Karistal a letter. It should reach her in a day or two. Meanwhile, we must get ready to leave. The outsider cannot stay within these walls any longer.
-We? asks Phoebey.
-It appears that your mind is already set, Miss Phoebey. It would be irresponsible of me to let you go alone.
-But Phoebey, what about your son? asks Ferlin.
-He's spending the weekend at my sister's. I'll just ask her to babysit him a little while longer. I'm sure she won't mind.
-But what if we don't come back?
-We? asks Bob.
-What? I'm coming too!
-Ferlin. I really think you should stay.
-Bob, I'm old, not dead. Life has never been as interesting as it is since Ulko appeared at my door. I feel alive again!
Bob shakes his head. He seems tired and not in the mood to argue.
-I'll write the letter. Go prepare your things and meet me in the yard in 20 minutes.
They all stand up to leave.
-And outsider, continues Bob. Try to avoid being seen.

Ulko, Phoebey and Ferlin are standing in the yard.
-Why do we have to walk? asks Ulko. I thought you could teleport around.
-I can, says Phoebey, but the magic waves would get us noticed. It's better to enter Helmwood discreetly. It's not a very commendable place.
-Commendable. Coming from you, I take it that we're heading straight into a den full of demonic viking-pirates.

At that moment, Bob appears.
-Miss Phoebey, he says, I would like to talk to you before we leave.
-Sure.
-In private.
They walk away, out of hearing reach.
-What's up with that? asks Ulko.
-Bob has always been protective of Phoebey. That's just the way he is.
-Can't he be protective with us around?
Ferlin shrugs. Bob and Phoebey return. Phoebey's face looks a bit pale.
-Are you feeling alright, dear? asks Ferlin.
-Yes. I think I caught something. It's nothing.
-Are you sure you can make this trip? Maybe you should stay here if you're feeling unwell.
-No, I'm fine. Professor Bobalthar is helping with his white magic.
Ferlin looks at Bob who gives him a nod.
-Okay then, says Ferlin. You're the expert.

Later that day, the small group is walking through fields and farms. The sun is shining and the day is hot. Ferlin is carried by the wind as usual, and as usual, Ulko is lagging behind.
-You better keep up, outsider, says Bob.
-Ulko isn't used to walking this fast, says Phoebey. Maybe we could slow down a little bit?
-There's no time. I want to get to Ferdoon before nightfall.

Phoebey slows down to wait for Ulko. They walk together in silence for a while before Ulko speaks.
-Why do you... not call me by my first name? he asks, struggling to breathe and talk at the same time.
-It just... feels weird to me.
-Why is that?
-David is the name I gave my son.
-I would call that... a coincidence. David... David is a fairly common name.
-Not around here.
Ulko looks at her before nodding pensively to himself.
They continue walking in silence.

They finally reach Ferdoon as the sun goes down. Ulko is winded and sweaty. He leans on a tree, trying to catch his breath.

Ferdoon is a tiny town, with only one inn in the middle of farms. As they approach, the potbellied man who's sitting on the porch stands up and greets Bob.
-Bobalthar! he says. What a nice surprise! How are ya? 
-I'm well. It's good to see you, Mac. You appear to be doing quite well too, Bob says, glancing at Mac's generous mid-section.
Mac pats his belly and laughs wholeheartedly.
-Haha, yes! Business has been good this year, and we had a good harvest.
Bob smiles.
-That's good to hear. Is there any chance we can get a room or two for tonight?
-I don't have my nose on the registry, but I do believe I have two rooms available. Come on in!

Ulko and Ferlin are sitting on the beds in one of the rooms.
-Don't flatter yourself, says Ulko, you weren't my first choice.
-Ah, don't be like that, says Ferlin. It's just for one night.
Suddenly, Ferlin has a fit of cough. Mechanically, Ulko hands him the magic vial.
-I'm worried about that cough, he says. It should have receeded by now-
Ulko marks a pause and looks at Ferlin, staring at him intently. Ferlin looks down at the floor in shame while taking a sip from the vial.
-You're faking it! exclaims Ulko.
Ulko leans his back against the wall and closes his eyes.
-Jesus. I turned grandpa into a drug addict.
Ferlin gives back the vial and Ulko raises it up.
-Cheers! he says before taking a swig.

Later that night, Ferlin is sleeping. Ulko gets out of the room discreetly and walks towards Bob's room.
-What are you doing? asks Rey.
-I want to know what Bob is hiding from us.
-Don't you think it's intrusive?
-Don't you think I don't care?
Rey sighs.

Ulko presses his eye against the keyhole. Phoebey and Bob are both sitting on their beds, facing each other. But something's wrong, Phoebey appears to be translucent. We can see right through her. Bob is holding her arm up and looking at it from different angles in the moonlight.
-Professor, I'm scared, she says.
-Don't be. I got you.
Then he takes both of her arms and starts muttering the words of a counter-spell while frowning in concentration. Slowly, Phoebey seems to recover her opacity.
Bob grabs his chest and slouches forward, trying to catch his breath.
-Are you okay professor? worries Phoebey.
-Yes, he says in a weak voice.
Phoebey grabs a jar of water and pours a glass that she hands to Bob.
-Thank you.
Bob takes a few gulps and places the glass on the night table.
-This curse... is taking a toll on all of us, he says before lying on his bed.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
Phoebey stares at him, slightly horrified.
-Goodnight, professor.





Chapter 5: The Witch

It's morning. Ulko is sitting in bed, his legs still under the covers. He's sipping on his vial.
-Admit you have feelings for her, says Rey.
-And how can I not just be concerned for a damsel in distress like a true gentleman?
-You're not a gentleman.
-Damn, you got me.
-You should tell her.
Ulko sighs.
-What good would that do, he says while pulling the covers over himself and resting his head back on the pillow.

There's a knock on the door.
-Downstairs in 15 minutes! commands Bob from the other side. And, outsider, you better be on time!

The weather is gray. The clouds threaten to break into rain any minute.
Ferlin steps outside where Bob and Phoebey are waiting.
-I hope it's not going to rain, he says.
-I'll deploy a shield, says Bob. It's no issue.
-Professor Bobalthar, says Phoebey, you don't have to. It's just water, we can handle it.
Bob puts his hand on Phoebey's shoulder.
Ulko steps out, rubbing is forehead. Bob looks at him.
-Good! We should be able to reach Helmwood by mid-day. Let's go!

Half-way to Helmwood, the group is suddenly surrounded by witches who appeared out of nowhere.
-You again! exclaims Phoebey, recognizing the witch who had snatched Ulko's bag.
-Step aside! says the witch. We want the outsider!
-We're delivering him to Mother Karistal, says Bob. Let us pass.
-I don't believe you!
-Ask her. She should have received my letter by now.
-What letter? I haven't heard of no letter!
-You're lying! says Phoebey, reading the witch's mind.
-Mind your own business, witch!
-As you wish, but we're not leaving Ulko!
-Then, we fight!

They fight the witches but are outnumbered. Soon enough, they are forced to surrender.
-If you like the outsider so much, then you too will rot in our dungeon! says the witch. Take them! she orders.
The witches grab all of them and open up several portals.

The next thing we know, the group is sitting in a cell in a cold and dark dungeon.
-Well, technically, we're right where we wanted to be, says Ulko.
-In a dungeon? says Bob.
Ulko shrugs.
-At least we didn't have to walk.
At that moment, the cell door opens.
-Stand up, scums! orders the witch. Mother Karistal requested an audience with you.

Their hands still in shackles, they are taken through a long corridor that leads to a large and lavish room.
An elegant middle-aged witch is sitting on a throne placed on some sort of pedestal. The back of the throne rises all the way to the ceiling and merges with the walls.
-At last, she says solemly, I get to meet you, outsider.
-Howdy, says Ulko.
-Professor Bobalthar, she continues, producing a piece of paper from her lap. I was intrigued by your letter. May I hear an explanation?
Bob steps forward.
-The outsider is wreaking havoc in our university. I feel that my offer would be beneficial to us both.
Mother Karistal lifts a hand with long painted nails to her face.
-I have rarely seen you being reasonable, Bobalthar. What got into you?
-I have no choice, Karistal. So, deal?
She turns to the witches standing behind the group.
-Free them of their shackles, she orders, they are not our prisoners, they are our guests.
The witches comply.
-I want the outsider's bag, says Mother Karistal.
-I need proof that you can open a portal to his plane first, says Bob.
-Fair enough.
She grabs a scepter and concentrates for a few seconds. A tiny portal opens next to her. We can see the town of Falding on the other side.
-Hey, exclaims Ulko, that's my town!
-Is it to your satisfaction? asks Karistal.
-Perfectly, says Bob.
-Now, the outsider's bag.
Karistal beckons to Ulko. He takes a few hesitant steps and looks back at Phoebey. Then he looks at Bob.
-I'm not responsible for the curse, he says.
-Outsider, don't start this now! says Bob. You got what you wanted! Shut up and take it!
Ulko takes a few more steps, staring at Mother Karistal.
-What do you know about the curse? he asks. Something tells me that if the university was to disappear, you wouldn't exactly shed a tear.
Karistal puts her long hand over her smiling lips.
-You're interesting, outsider. But I'm afraid this is confidential information.
-Do your minions know that while you're chasing this old thing, a bunch of kids' lives are being ruined?
Mother Karistal frowns.
-I feel this conversation is going nowhere. Now, the bag.
-Sure. May I suggest a place where you can potentially shove it up?
-You fool! says Bob.
Mother Karistal leans back into her throne, looking disappointed.
-That's too bad, she says. It means I'll have to take it by force.
-Do you really have to pick this particular time to be a hero! complains Bob. Just give her the bag and go!
-Don't you see that sending me away won't solve anything! I'm not causing the curse, she is!
-Since when do you care!
-Since...
He looks at Phoebey.
-Nevermind. I just won't let the witch get away with it! Bob! If you really care about the university, you will fight with me!
-That's Bobalthar for you!
Bob looks at Ferlin.
-In what kind of trouble did you get me again.
-Like the good old days! says Ferlin.

They fight Mother Karistal and manage to get her to her knees. But as she feigns to surrender, she lifts the scepter once again and opens the portal wider, until it starts absorbing objects from the room. Ulko gets sucked into it against his will.
-No! he yells, stretching out his hand.
-Bon voyage!
The image of Mother Karistal fades as the portal closes on what appears to be the entire existence of things.

Ulko briefly loses consciousness and wakes up in Falding's monastery. When he regains his senses, he jumps to his feet, desperately looking around for the portal.
-No no no no no, he repeats in a panic. Wait, the monks! Surely they'll be able to send me back!
He runs frantically in the corridors and finds the room where the monks used to sit in a circle, reading their book.

Though it looks more like a battlefield now. All the monks are lying dead. All except for one. He's sitting on the ground, slouched forward and feeble. Using the last of his strength, he hands the book he was reading to Ulko. Ulko looks around.
-I'm not touching it, he says, it's full of deadly germs.
But the monk insists and pushes the book into Ulko's hands.

Reluctantly, Ulko starts to read, skipping through pages.
Weird glitches start appearing all over the screen. They intensify until the game crashes.

When the game recovers, the screen fades between transparent and opaque in a cyclic fashion, letting the player's desktop show underneath.
The cycle looks as if it would continue until the end of time. A little boy claps his hands.
-Are you a wizard?
Feeling weak, Ulko falls back down onto the bed as the woman comes back.
-Please Paul, our guest needs to rest.
-Yes, mama.
The little boy leaves. The woman puts a jug of water and a piece of bread on the night table. She then starts to unbutton Ulko's shirt. He grabs her hand.
-I want to see if you're hurt, she says.
-I'm fine.
-Then I suppose...
-Ulko.
-What?
-My name is Ulko.
-Oh. Ok.
They both look at each other in silence.
-I'll let you rest now. Yell if you need anything.
-Not going to do that. But thanks.

The woman sits alone at the kitchen table, staring at the photograph of a man.
-Why does he look so much like you? she wonders.






Chapter 6: The Butterfly

The following morning, Ulko is standing outside the house, leaning on a piece of wood. Rey is flying around him. Phoebey comes out.
-You seem to have regained some of your strength.
-Do you know how I can get out of here?
-Get out of here? I suppose you must be in a rush. Where are you from?
-The real world.
-I'm sorry?
-Sorry, I'm still trying to figure out whether this place is a hallucination or a dream. So far, I'm leaning more towards the former.
-Then, maybe you should stay here for a while.
-Would love to, but I believe I left the stove on in another hallucination. Excuse me.
Ulko starts to walk down the path to the North, leaning on his improvised walking stick.
-Wait!
Phoebey runs back into the house.
-You should ask her to tag along, says Rey.
-I don't need to carry any extra luggage.
-Look, ever had that feeling that your gut is trying to tell you something? Don't argue, just listen.
-Ooof, yeah. I think those tacos had spent too much time in the sun.
-You're hopeless.
Rey flies back into Ulko's bag as Phoebey comes back with a small bag of her own.
-Who were you talking with? she asks.
-Nothing. My conscience.
-Two synonyms apparently, sulks Rey.
Ulko starts to leave without taking the lunch bag.
-You should try speaking with the wizard of the lighthouse, says Phoebey as Ulko walks away. He'll give you some good advice. He can be found at the end of the northern path.

They walk all day, the ocean to their left and farms and fields to their right. The lighthouse becomes visible on a cliff as the sun goes down beneath the waves. Exhausted from the long walk, Ulko stops, leaning on his stick. His stomach grumbles.
-You should have taken the lunch bag, says Rey.
-Hunger means nothing in a dream.
-Well, it makes you grumpy, for one.
-You're the one making me grumpy.

Ulko climbs the hill that leads to the lighthouse. It's getting dark but the beacon isn't lit yet.
-Whatever you do, says Rey, please don't drug the old wizard.
-Why would I do that?
Moments later the wizard is dancing around the white fire.
-Thank you stranger! I had no idea how I was going to get up those stairs! I feel like a 120 year old again!
-Calm down. You'll hurt yourself.
-What is this magic? You must be a very powerful wizard!
-Sort of. Listen, I need your help to go back to where I come from.
-I'm afraid I would make a pretty terrible guide.
-I'm not from this world.
-Really?

The wizard approaches Ulko with curiosity. He grabs his hands, palms facing up.
-Interesting. It seems your existence has no beginning and no end. Very interesting indeed.
-It is interesting, says Rey.
-Since when do you care about palm reading? asks Ulko.
-It's not palm reading! complains the wizard. Palm reading is for quacks! I'm connecting my existence to yours through your hands so I can look into your soul. That's very advanced wizardry. Do not take me for a conjurer of cheap tricks!
-Chill out, Gandalf. I wasn't talking to you.
-Who then?
-Imaginary friend. What else do you see?
-I see...
The wizard squints as he takes Ulko's hands closer to his face.
-I see you're an idiot.
-Wow. Impressive.
-A complete stupid idiotic idiot.
-Look, that's very powerful magic you got there, but I really need to go home.
Ulko frees himself and turns his back to leave.
-You think you're going to walk there?
-I'll call a cab.
Without a word, the wizard slips under the covers of his own improvised bed and points to a rag on the floor.
Reluctantly, Ulko sits down and takes out his magic vial.
-What are you doing? asks Rey.
-I'll need some powerful magic too if we're going to sleep on the floor.
-The wizard is right, you are an idiot.
-Interesting diagnosis. Let's get tarot cards tomorrow to confirm.
-You should have asked the girl to come with you.
-Should, could, would, all a bunch of words. Shoulds are to woulds as woulds are to-
Ulko scrunches his face, pretenting to think.
-And you should allow the wizard to help you.
-Damn, that sounded way smarter in my head.
Ulko drinks from the vial before lying down.
He's exhausted and hungry, but soon both of those sensations go away as he drifts into a peaceful slumber.

The morning sun shines through Ulko's eyelids as a throbbing headache wakes him up. He sits down slowly, a hand on his forehead.
-You look like shit, says Rey.
-I slept on the goddamn floor.
Ulko pauses.
-Huh.
-What?
-Deja vu.
He takes a sip from his vial.
-Come on. You know your headache is caused by hunger and dehydration.
-See any water or food around?

Ulko and the wizard are sitting down on the floor, legs crossed. Ulko is eating the food this time.
-You seem to like it, says the wizard.
-I don't know. I'm acting on instinct. I don't even know-
Ulko pauses.
-Is it always this hot in here? I thought you put out the fire.
-I did.
Ulko unbuttons the top of his shirt to cool himself off. He's sweating and breathing heavily.
-Are you okay, son?
Ulko blinks a few times and leans back against the wall.
-What's wrong? asks Rey.
-Hyperthermia. Diaphoresis. Vertigo.
The room appears to be spinning. He looks around then puts two fingers against his throat to measure his heart rate.
-Tachycardia. You- you bastard, he whispers. You poisoned me!
The room is getting more and more distorted as Ulko desperately crawls towards his bag.
-You know it's useless, says Rey. You have no idea what poison this is.
-Can't you tell me? You- must have some clue!... You- you're my intuition!...
-That's not my name. Think again.
As the vision of Rey swirls into a blur, Ulko's head drops to the floor and his hand falls right beside the bag he was trying to reach.

As he regains consciousness, his eyes open and close heavily on a plain white ceiling. He's lying on his back. There are voices near him.
-It was foolish of you to make this trip Ferlin, scolds Bob. But I'm happy to see you.
-It's all thanks to my friend. He's a powerful sorcerer.
Bob turns to Ulko.
-He doesn't seem so powerful to me.
-Can you do anything to help him?
Bob frowns and kneels beside Ulko.
-How long has he been like this?
-3 days.
-What did you say you fed him?
-Just the usual bromfedesh. It's packed full of nutrients! Very healthy food!
-For us maybe. He's not from this plane.
Ferlin looks down at floor, ashamed of himself for not having thought of that.
Bob puts a hand on his shoulder.
-Don't worry Ferlin. I'll fix him.
Ulko starts coughing as he turns to his side.
-Stay still, outsider. I've got you.
Bobalthar then puts his hands on Ulko's chest and magic waves start pouring through him into his whole body. Spasms shake Ulko as a vaporous substance emanates from his chest and hands.
After the procedure, Ulko seems to relax. His limbs lay numb over the couch. Bob lets out a sigh.
-Good, he says. Now, please, escort the outsider out of the school grounds.
-But, complains Ferlin, we need to send him back! We can't let him wander around!
-You asked me to fix him. Consider it done. There's nothing more I can do.
Ulko suddenly sits up and nervously looks around the room.
-You know it wasn't the wizard's fault, says Rey.
Ulko stands up to grab his bag. He turns when he reaches the doorframe.
-Which way is the exit?
Bob points to the right. Ulko leaves.

Ulko walks out in the corridor and takes out his vial. He takes a big gulp of it.
-Here we go again, complains the bird.
-I'm in pain. This is pain medicine.
-You should go look for Phoebey.
-Who?

At the same moment, a strange woman bumps into Ulko and snatches his bag.
-Hey that's mine! yells Ulko.
She opens up a portal to run away, but Ulko is fast enough to jump into it before it closes. They both end up in a completely different city. Ulko catches a glimpse of the woman and runs after her. The chase lasts a few minutes through the city streets when suddenly, the woman turns around and sends a bunch of gravel flying fast towards Ulko.
Ulko is hurt but he keeps chasing her. It seems the woman is about to get away when a glitched figure jumps down from a rooftop right in front of her.

There's a glitched fight between them. The glitched figure of Phoebey presents weird moves like "You Forgot Me". Ulko has a lapse of consciousness while the fight is going on.

He falls down on the couch, still trying to catch his breath.
-Nice timing, he says.
-Those damn witches, curses the glitched figure. Always up to no good!
-Hey! calls Rey.
-Aren't you a witch too?
-I'm a good witch, not like them.
-Hello? asks Rey. Ground control to Major Dumb??
-That's fortunate.
-Ulko!
-You're lucky I saw you. I had a bad feeling on my way to class and ran back here. A minute later and you would have been stuck in Helmwood. Not a place you want to be stuck in.
-Anywhere in here is a place I don't want to be stuck in- Ow!
Ulko turns to Rey.
-What was that for?
-You're talking to yourself!
He turns to see that the glitched figure has disappeared.

He puts his hand on his forehead.
-I was dreaming. Could be an effect of the poison I ingested.
At that moment, Bob enters. He's holding a bunch of files.
-What are you still doing in my office?
A huge glitch moves the story forward. Bob is sitting at his desk.
He distractly looks at the files, apparently deep in thought. After a moment he says:
-Outsider! Come here.
Bob takes out a piece of paper from one of the files.
-I need you to sign this.
Ulko stands up slowly and walks towards him. He grabs the quill that Bob hands him. The document makes no sense, given that Bob had no intention of enrolling Ulko.
-What is this?
Ulko doesn't sign it, the document signs itself.
-Congratulations. You're now officially a student. Classes start tomorrow. Here's your schedule.
-What great news! exclaims a scary glitch. I'm so glad.
-Now, dismissed. I have work to do.

Ulko ends up in the corridor. It's now late afternoon. Golden rays stripe the light colored floor.
-What the hell was that about? says Ulko.
-I think we screwed up man, says Rey. Big time!
-Yeah. I never asked to be enrolled in this school. School is boring.
-No! I'm telling you buddy, this is BAD! We messed up the story!
-What story?
-You must be tired, says a scary glitch.
-That's an understatement.
-I guess I'll let you rest then.
-That would be best, yes.
-Ok. So, YOU FORGOT ME, see you tomorrow?
-What did you say?
-See you tomorrow.
-I mean before that.
-Who's DAVID?
-What?
-Who's DAVID?




Chapter 7: The Outsider

At that moment, the game crashes. Subtle glitches are visible on the player's desktop. When the game recovers, the starting screen is messed up for a moment before going back to normal.

-You better keep up, outsider, says Bob. I want to get to Ferdoon before nightfall.
A glitched figure slows down to wait for Ulko. They walk together in silence for a while before Ulko speaks.
-Why do you... not call me by my first name? he asks, struggling to breathe and talk at the same time.
-Are you talking to me? asks Rey.
-Why is that?
-What do you mean "why is that"! Because there's no one else here!
-I would call that... a coincidence. Paul... Paul is a fairly common name.
-Ulko! You're not making any sense!
Ulko nods pensively to himself and continue walking in silence.

Flash forward.
The weather is gray. The clouds threaten to break into rain any minute.
Ferlin steps outside where Bob is waiting.
-I hope it's not going to rain, he says.
-I'll deploy a shield, says Bob. It's no issue.
Ulko steps out, rubbing is forehead. Bob looks at him.
-Good! We should be able to reach Helmwood by mid-day. Let's go!

Half-way to Helmwood, the group is suddenly surrounded by witches who appeared out of nowhere.
-Step aside! says the witch. We want the outsider!
-We're delivering him to Mother Karistal, says Bob. Let us pass.
-I don't believe you!
-Ask her. She should have received my letter by now.
-What letter? I haven't heard of no letter!
-Don't make it any more difficult than it has to be.
-I think you stole my line!

During the fight, half of Ulko's spells appear broken because he never learned them.
They fight the witches but are outnumbered. Soon enough, they are forced to surrender.
-If you like the outsider so much, then you too will rot in our dungeon! says the witch. Take them! she orders.
The witches grab all of them and open up several portals.

The next thing we know, the group is sitting in a cell in a cold and dark dungeon.
-Well, technically, we're right where we wanted to be, says Ulko.
-In a dungeon? says Bob.
Ulko shrugs.
-At least we didn't have to walk.
At that moment, the cell door opens.
-Stand up, scums! orders the witch. Mother Karistal requested an audience with you.

Their hands still in shackles, they are taken through a long corridor that leads to a large and lavish room.
An elegant middle-aged witch is sitting on a throne placed on some sort of pedestal. The back of the throne rises all the way to the ceiling and merges with the walls.
-At last, she says solemly, I get to meet you, outsider.
-Howdy, says Ulko.
-Professor Bobalthar, she continues, producing a piece of paper from her lap. I was intrigued by your letter. May I hear an explanation?
Bob steps forward.
-The outsider is wreaking havoc in our university. I feel that my offer would be beneficial to us both.
Mother Karistal lifts a hand with long painted nails to her face.
-I have rarely seen you being reasonable, Bobalthar. What got into you?
-I have no choice, Karistal. So, deal?
She turns to the witches standing behind the group.
-Free them of their shackles, she orders, they are not our prisoners, they are our guests.
The witches comply.
-I want the outsider's bag, says Mother Karistal.
-I need proof that you can open a portal to his plane first, says Bob.
-Fair enough.
She grabs a scepter and concentrates for a few seconds. A tiny portal opens next to her. We can see the town of Falding on the other side.
-Hey, exclaims Ulko, that's my town!
-Is it to your satisfaction? asks Karistal.
-Perfectly, says Bob.
-Now, the outsider's bag.
Karistal beckons to Ulko. Ulko steps forward and gives her his bag.
-Just like that? I was expecting more resistance.
She opens it and finds a book. The same book the monks were reading.
-What's that? asks Ulko. That's not mine.
-Yes. I know for a fact that it is not yours, outsider.
-I have a bad feeling about this! says Rey.
Karistal puts her long hand over her smiling lips.
-Interesting. I get to meet you too.
-Who? Me? asks Rey.
-Did you really think you could save the story, little bird? Your actions only brought forth that which you fear. Now the girl is completely erased. Even Bobalthar couldn't save her from oblivion.
Ulko looks at Karistal and Rey.
-Wait. You can see him?
-It's not my fault! complains Rey. Ulko wouldn't listen to me!
-Hello? asks Ulko.
-Frustrating, I know. No matter what you do, the monks will die. And the story will die with them. It is inevitable.
-Just going to ignore me. Noted.
-You mean the monks back in Falding? asks Rey. Are you the one killing them?
-No. They are dying because the story is fading. And the story is fading because they are dying. I have nothing to do with it.
-That sounds impossibly recursive to me, says Ulko.
-Your very existence is recursive, outsider. Is the monastery where the story ends or where it begins? What would have happened if you had given me the bag the last time we met? Would the book be in there, or not? There is no way to tell, for it is both there and not there.
Ulko fakes smoking a joint.
-Stop it! she snaps.
-What's so special about that book anyways? Why do you want it?
-It holds a power far beyond my comprehension. You see, every story is contained within a story that is contained within a story. It is the substance of the Universe. But your story is different, it is contained within itself. It is both finite and infinite. An anomaly. Something spawned it into existence, something that I wish to know.
-Look, I take my question back, I don't really care. Keep the damn book. I just want to go home.
-You have no home to go to.
Karistal closes the portal.
-Hey! I thought we had a deal!
-I'm sorry, but I can only send you to where you don't want to go.
Karistal opens up a new portal, this time we see the university.
-You must be kidding me!
-Tell me, outsider, would she have ceased to exist if you hadn't tried to save her? Would you have tried to save her if she hadn't ceased to exist? Was she saved or was she doomed?
-That circular bullshit again? I don't even know who you're talking about!
-The woman you love, you dumbass! complains Rey. I kept trying to tell you!
-Love? wonders Karistal.
-Alright, that's enough! says Bob. The deal is off! Give us the book back! I'd rather not it be in your hands!
Bob looks at Ferlin.
-In what kind of trouble did you get me again.
-Like the good old days! says Ferlin.

They fight Mother Karistal. During the fight, we see that Ulko has several glitched spells.
They manage to get Karistal to her knees. But as she feigns to surrender, she lifts the scepter once again and opens the portal wider, until it starts absorbing objects from the room. Ulko gets sucked into it against his will.
-No! he yells, stretching out his hand.
-Bon voyage!
The image of Mother Karistal fades as the portal closes on what appears to be the entire existence of things.

Out in the yard, Ferlin and Phoebey are standing a few feet from each other. Bob is watching from a distance.
Ferlin and Phoebey look at the ground.
-Oh well, says Phoebey. I guess I better go back to my studies.
-And I suppose I should return to my lighthouse.
Bob puts a hand on Ferlin's shoulder.
-You can stay here for as long as you want, Ferlin.
They all stay there in solemn silence when Ulko walks in.
Bob bursts out laughing.
-Alright. I have to go give a lecture now. It was entertaining!
Bob leaves.

-What happened? asks Phoebey.
-I ended up in the library.
-Hm. Maybe you didn't use enough ether. You should try again.
-Is it normal that I feel like shit though?
-Teleportation sickness is normal. Take a deep breath. It will pass.

They repeat the same ritual. This time, Ulko wakes up in the middle of the monastery. He looks around. Everything seems blurry and wavy.
-Did I do it? he says to himself, trying to catch his breath. Right. I remember. They drugged me and left me there to have fun in lala land. I guess it was all just a dream after all. A very vivid one.
He puts a hand on his hurting forehead and manages to stand up.
-Ugh. Whatever it is they gave me, it's rough on the landing.
-Are you talking to yourself again? asks Rey.
-Hm. It seems the effects haven't completely worn off yet.
-Hey! I'm not a hallucination!
-Look, I'm okay talking to myself so long as I don't answer back. Stop talking.
Ulko continues to walk around, leaning on the walls to keep from falling.
Exploring the monastery as best as he can, he ends up in a room where the monks are sitting in a circle, reading their book.
-Hello? he calls. Sorry to interrupt your little book club. Can anybody tell me where the exit is?
All the monks look at him at the same time.
-What? Ulko shrugs.
The monks look at each other.
-The outsider is here.
-I guess I'll just go. You're obviously busy.
The monks get closer to Ulko.
-Woah, I get the sense that we started on the wrong foot here. Hi. I'm Dr. Ulko.

Unfortunately for him, the monks got the story backwards and believed that the presence of the outsider caused the disease, and not that the disease caused the presence of the outsider. Whether or not they were right is anybody's guess.

Ulko wakes up again, this time in a bedroom in a small house. There's a woman tending to him. A little boy is watching. He's licking a red sucker.
-Take it easy, she says. How did you end up on the beach?
There's a silence. Ulko puts his hand on his forehead.
-Don't you remember? she asks.
-Do you have any aspirin?
-I don't know what that is.
-Nevermind. Where am I?
-In my house. My name is Phoebey. What's your name?
-I didn't ask for your name.
-It's David! says the little boy, enthusiastically.
-Hey, how do you know that? asks Ulko.
-It's easy! It's the same as me!
Phoebey looks at her son, puzzled.
-I didn't know the two of you had met before.
-That's because we haven't, says Ulko.
-We did too! On the beach!
-I think she meant before that. Which is factually impossible.
-Though, you do remind me of someone, says Phoebey. Do you have a brother perhaps?
-Even if I did, I doubt he could join me in this vivid nightmare.
Phoebey looks at the ground.
-I see. I just thought...
She looks at Ulko again, her brows furrowed in thought.
-Who are you? she asks.
-Nobody. Just an outsider.
